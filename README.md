# Change Sora's outfit midgame
This is a mod for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in which you can change Sora's outfits while playing a match.


Under normal circumstances you would pick the outfit you want for your character on the CSS (Character Select Screen).

But this mod aims to allow you to change your characters outfit in game on the fly during a game using the taunts that the game normally binds to the D pad.

This mod is intended for use on the KH2 and KH3 Sora slots (c01 & c05, c03 & c07), for the fact that KH2 has the drive form system and KH3 has the formchange system allowing for this to be seemless while appearing accurate to the games.
