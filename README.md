# Change Sora's outfit midgame
This is a mod for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in which you can change Sora's outfits while playing a match.


Under normal circumstances you would pick the outfit you want for your character on the CSS (Character Select Screen).

But this mod aims to allow you to change your characters outfit in game on the fly during a game using the taunts that the game normally binds to the D pad.

This mod is intended for use on the KH2 and KH3 Sora slots (c01 & c05, c03 & c07), for the fact that KH2 has the drive form system and KH3 has the formchange system allowing for this to be seemless while appearing accurate to the games.

The code for this project is built using the rust programming language, which you can learn more about here: https://rust-lang.org/learn ... As well as the Smashline 2 API, this gives me the functions necessary to make this mod a reality, you can learn more about Smashline here: https://github.com/HDR-Development/smashline/wiki/ACMD#acmd-scripts

For now this mod is only built to work with Sora (Because he's my favorite) for now, but there's no reason as to why it may not support more characters in the distant future.
